DGB_UTAV_patch-KAVT_UTAV_PAK_AkELkA


Just drag and drop to override the UTAV or KAVT PAK files
(KAVT NVP - Kazstra's Virtual Tav Non-Virtual Port, and KAVT - Kazstra's Virtual Tav, the VT one, since DGB is not VT there), then repack the mod.

And Delete CLEA from your generated folder, it does not need to anything, only confusing people who doing assets for your mod
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod fixes multiple issues with Dragonborns in Unique Tav Custom Appearance (UTAV) and KAVT, remaking all Dragonborn parts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE LOG

DATA (Generated folder files) changed, as well as the KAVT Generated folder. This patch works for BOTH:

✧ Draconic Bloodline textures added in DATA files for male and female separately.
Vanilla uses one shared texture for both body types. Since UTAV and KAVT are about uniqueness, I find that unacceptable, so I separated them.

✧ Tail textures added separately in case people want to make their own variations.
Since the meshes were already present in UTAV, having the textures included is only logical.

✧ CLEA textures removed.
They are unused for Dragonborn. Please stop using them, they are just rudiments.
If you want to understand what textures actually do for Dragonborn, check the BG3 Wiki page I made a year ago:
https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Modding:Face_and_body_textures#Dragonborn

✧ Body textures now contain the same fixes as my Seam Mender mod for bodies
(does not include head fixes).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

PAK file issue fixes present in both KAVT and UTAV:

✧ All the same changes as in the Generated Data folder.

✧ Body assets no longer use Vanilla UUIDs for textures, materials, or assets.
Now they are correctly separated from NPCs, which is the whole point of Unique Tav.

✧ Draconic Bloodline switch file added.

✧ Draconic Bloodline for bodies now REALLY uses a unique texture instead of the Vanilla one.
In original UTAV it wasn’t even present in the folder, not set up, and not separated.
Now it is separated by body type as well.

✧ Draconic Bloodline for heads now works in UTAV and KAVT.
Before, heads did not switch their material to Draconic Bloodline stripes.

✧ UTAV tails and private parts added as separate buttons in CC.

✧ Body textures for the Vanilla variation match my Seam Mender fixes.

✧ Cloth Collider for males changed to DRAGONBON one, dunno why in file it uses HUM one, when even Vanilla uses DGB one. 
Female still uses HUM FS one since this is what Vanilla uses (Clawstep patch will override it to my DGB F custom one)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

PAK file issue fixes for UTAV:

✧ Fixed a typo in a UUID that prevented Female Head 4 from using UTAV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

VANILLA BUG FIXED:

✧ Draconic Bloodline default Durge head can now use Makeup
(I included the same fix in the last DMH update as well).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRA:

✧ All my PUBLISHED heads patched for Draconic Bloodline.

✧ "NPC" head variations also patched with Draconic Bloodline for the Dragonborn NPC CC Head mod.

✧ Buttons for Body Selector for Fleshforge pre-set for me to switch on in a separate file.

✧ New Draconic Bloodline drawn for tails(C and B for both body types) and priv parts (fem)

✧ Draconic Bloodline now works for Tails B, C and private parts (Vanilla ones does not have switch)
Therefore Female in Vanilla when Draconic Bloodline selected have visible seam to Tail B, C and Private parts, so it's kinda needed
